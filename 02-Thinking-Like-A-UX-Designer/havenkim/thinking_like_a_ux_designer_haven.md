# Thinking like a UX Designer

## User-Centered Design

A **User** is a person who is trying to solve a problem and is looking for a product or service to help them solve it.

**User Experience** is to make that product or service to solve the problem.

User-Centered Design is a Framework to put the user front-and-center. Keep the user at the cetner of every decision you make.

But to make that work, we should know the user well. And by focusing on the user, designers must consider the story, emotions, and insights gathered about them.

>There is no substitute for personally watching and listening to real people - Larry Page, Google.

You must ask yourself...

* Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider-whether temporary, situational, or permanent?
  * The term **accessibility** refers to the designs for people with disabilities. Making it accessible for all users.

* How familiar are my users with technology?
  * **Digital Literacy** is a key consideration. (The ability to user information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills)
* How are my users accessing the product or service?
* Where and when are my users accessing the product or service?
* Have I considered all my potential users?

## Assistive Technology (AT)

* Color modification
  * Increases the color contrast on a screen to make it esasier to see for users with low vision or eye strain.

* Voice Control & Switch Device
  * Allows navigate the product only with a voice.
  * Switch : An assistive technology device that replaces the need to use a computer keyboard or a mouse.

* Screen Readers

* Alternative Text
  * Use words for any meaningful images. Or under limited access situation.

> The strange thing about UX Design is that you won't really notice it if it's good design. You only notice it when it's bad.

## UX Design Frameworks

In UX Design, a framework stands for **a conceptual tool** that provides *guidance on the best practices* and *processes for solving problems and building solutions* that solve the problems of real users. It provides **structure for the design process** and foster collaboration, which can spark innovation.

In other words, it is a mindful toolkit you can follow while proceeding UX design process. Try following the guideline of the framework and check your step is in a good shape.

## Design Thinking Framework

**Design Thinking** framework is a problem-solving toolkit based on user-centered approach. It includes research, prototyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their problems are, and what your design should include.

Still, the framework is an just one of idealized model for UX designers to follow. Each phase can be a bit differ but mainly they would have something similar look. And they change overtime.

Even though they are placed in linear sequence order, each phase is iterative and should always go back to previous phases if it doesn't meet the goal. It means that you will repeat certain phases as you **Refine** your designs.

What the framework stands for is

* Focus on the user.
* Create many solutions that address the users' problems.
* Collaborate with teammembers.
* Validate the design

Iterate as much as needed to design it **right**

### Empathize

Your goal is to **Learn** more about the *user* and their *problems*, *needs*, and the environment or context in which they'll experience your design.

Keep up yourself to avoid assumptions and guesses you have but let your research findings inform your decision-making in later design phases.

* Research may include user surveys, interviews, and observation sessions.

* You need to conduct some research on the competitors' or benchmarkable products to determine what they are good at, how they are solving the problems.

### Define

Your goal is to analyze your research findings and determine which user problems are the most important to be solved and why.

The best output of this phase is a **Clear Problem Statement** that the UX Design will follow.

And you might also develop a **Value Proposition**, the reason why the user should use the product or service.

### Ideate

From what you have learned and the Problem statement you defined, you set your goal to come up with as many design solutions as possible.
    - Do not settle for your first solution because *the most obvious solution is **not** always the right one*.

With lots of brainstorming with other members, analyze potential solutions and start to make choices about which ones are the best options to pursue as prototypes.

### Prototype and Test

Finally, from the ideated result, start making a lo-fi prototype or any early type of the model to demonstrate its functionalities and use for testing.

Prototyping and Testing are *interconnected*. You will **continuously test** the prototype in the middle of design. But **do not make it over-perfect** since it might be hard to get valuable feedbacks. Try to **focus on feedbacks** to change the prototype, not on the other reasons.

## Type of Designs to put users front-and-center

>Initially...

* Universal Design - How to include even broader range of users?
  * The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilties and situations.
  * **But** the problem is when the design focuses on creating **One** solution for everyone, design tends to lose its effectiveness. Because there are so many intented users.
  * *One size fits all* approach is the good description of this. But as we know already, it cannot be an ultimate solution.
  * *Result? => Didn't meet the every user's need.*

>Then the design trend moved on to...

* Inclusive Design - Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers
  * Such as *Ability, Race, Economic Status, Language, Age, Gender, etc.*
  * Solve for a one specific group of users and that benefits other groups as well.
  * Solve for one, *extend to many*
  * But it only benefits the group was designed for and the existing users. Many groups are still leftout.

>At the end, we are now on...

* Equity-focused Design - Designing for groups that have been *historically* underrepresented or ignored when building products.
  * *Historically* in this context stands for the *ungiven opportunities to access* previously. Not something too heavy political problems.
    * Equality -> Providing the *same* amount of opportunity and support.
    * Equity -> Providing *different levels of oppotunity* and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes.

    ![Equality vs Equity](./images/equality_vs_equity.png)

Any of designs still don't solve all problems. But they are trying hard to focus on providing accessibilities to underrepresented, ignored, or less focused users.

## Equity-focused Design

* Thinking through all the aspects of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilites.

## Different Platforms

### Platform

The medium that users experience your product on. Such as mobile web, apps, desktop, laptop, tablet, tv, etc.

In the present days, products are provided in lots of different platforms.

The design will start from a widely used & most engaging platform but it will start extending its environment to live in.

### Mobile vs Desktop

Users tent to spend 72 seconds in mobile session. Meanwhile, desktop session extends to 150 seconds. Depends on platforms, the goal of using them and way are very different.

To being inclusive, design should provide seamless difference in between platforms so that users would have same or similar experience and achieve the same goal no matter what they use.

### Mobile experiences to take account

1. Call-to-action *(n. an exhortation or stimulus to do something in order to achieve an aim or deal with a problem)* button should place in the center so that users can accomplish their task easily.

2. Menu Items should be short and simple. And they should only highlight the core funtionalities.

3. React to users' gestures. Like swiping, tapping should react in intuitive and expected way.

4. Orientations should be also under consideration.

5. Reduce visual clutter. To make visual experience simple, consider making them simple and clear.
