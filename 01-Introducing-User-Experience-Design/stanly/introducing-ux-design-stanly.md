### Goals for exploring UX design
Most of all, I want to get a firm grasp on the concept from this course. I learned the basics of UX at school, but I still need clarification about the term UX. Since the time was too short to learn every aspect, I had yet to get a holistic view of it.

I discovered that I had already utilized those frameworks at work while I was watching the video lessons. Interestingly, there are many similarities between game design and UX design. I was a game designer, and we always cared about our players' behaviors and experiences. Are they having fun? We always asked that question. And good UX also includes 'enjoyability' as one of the essential components.

I am pursuing this certificate since it will help me get a new opportunity. Or I can meet someone who can share ideas on UX or design. I'm thrilled now.
