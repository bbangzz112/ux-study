# Joining Design Sprint

## Design Sprint

Almost everything around you are started off as a design problem or design challenge.

A *time-bound process*, with five phases typically spread over 5 full 8-hour days. => Agile Development process

The goal of sprint is **to solve a critical design challenge** through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

Design sprint can be used to answer questions, define product direction, figure out cross-team strategies.

### Why we conduct a design sprint?

1. Save lots of time
    - Because it helps people to focus on what to do, and what is next, it helps saving time on decision making.
    - And because the whole week is all about the sprint, distractionless, gadgetless, creative collaboration elevates the most timely effective result.
  
2. Create an effective path to bring a product to market

3. Helps prioritizing the users putting them front-and-center

4. Helps fast-forward to the actual release by providing lots of testing chances
    - It helps lowering the risk of an unsuccessful market debut

5. It's all about the users
    - Sprint helps participants make sure the design challenge is always focused on the user and their needs.

6. Value every person in the room
    - Any people brings lots of knowledges(disciplines) and experiences into the design sprint which brings the best idea on top.

7. Versatile
    - Design sprint can be scheduled at any point during the project.
    - When a challenge arises, Design sprint is always a joker card on hand.

### When to run a design sprint?

- Are there *many potential solutions* to the design challenge?
- Does a design challenge require people from *cross-functional teams* to weigh in?
- Is the design challenge's scope *wide enough for a sprint*?


## Steps of Design Sprint

Phase 1. Understand

- Sets the sprint on the right track and helps the team get a clear picture of the design challenge.
- The team may take time to learn from experts and engage in creative discussions with a lot of different people from other departments and industries.

Phase 2. Ideate

- Pump full of inspiration to come up with lots of solution ideas.
- Each participant of the sprint takes time to sketch and present their ideas.
- Also while in the ideating phase, start a planning for user testing. Recruiting users will take time, so the preparation better start at this phase.

Phase 3. Decide

- Among all of amazing and potential solutions, make a decision on the best solutions to build.
- Wrap up the day by creating a step-by-step blueprint for a prototype tomorrow.

Phase 4. Prototype

- Build a first functional version of the idea which can be used for testing.
- Doesn't have to be a finished result, just something realistic enough to get most comprehensive feedback from users.
- And the team will be finalzing on testing schedules and plans.

Phase 5.

- Actually do a testing with users and gain critical insight about changes.

## How to prepare a Design Sprint

- Start User Research to come up with more ideas in details.
- Call in experts. Many Expertise, better opportunity
- Fine and book a right space.
  - Having white board or sticky notes to capture the ideas
  - Acoustics to improve audiblility
  - Cozy and easy-move furnitures. You will spend a week in this room.
- Gather supplies
  - Markers, sticky notes, snacks, water, etc.
- Establish sprint rule
  - Having rules will help people to focus on what should be done and make it more productive.
- Plan Introduction
  - Icebreakers to gather team around and make them feel comfortable each other.
  - ex) when was the last time did you call the customer service to complain?
- Post-Sprint planning
  - Think about what will happen after the sprint
  - Wrap up the sprint on a document with images, pictures, sticky notes, or any written materials
  - Enlish people to help this out.

## Conducting Design Sprint Restrospective

It is a collaborative critique of the team's design sprint. The team should immediately hold a retrospective for a fresh and on-going eyes. By reviewing the Design Sprints, we can improve ourselves and be even more productive next time.

- What went well?
  - Which tools saved you the most time and effort?
  - When did you feel the most satisfaction?
  - What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?

- What can be improved next time?
  - What went wrong that caught you off guard?
  - Which problems came up the most often?
  - When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?

** Often, it could be better to put anonymous sticky notes for sharing improvement ideas to avoid *Groupthink*. It will mask other people's think under that presented idea and the result of retrospective could be not useful.

- At the end, examine the sprint’s outcome or final product.
  - Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design?
  - Did an external factor derail your productivity?
  - And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?

You might want to ask yourself

- What did you discover during the sprint that you’re still wondering about?
- How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?
